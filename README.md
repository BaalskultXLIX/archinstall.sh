# This is a shell archinstall script 

This archinstall shell script was originally just for my own use, but I figured why not make it public, and besides, I can just copy it with git clone, which is easier.

Please use the official version of archinstall https://github.com/archlinux/archinstall?tab=GPL-3.0-1-ov-file

WARNING Please read my archinstall comments in the archinstall.sh and sorry for my bad english.
